# ## Construction

# A [`MultivariatePoissonProcess`](@ref) object is built from a vector of positive event rates.

位 = rand(5)
pp = MultivariatePoissonProcess(位)

# ## Simulation

# Since it is a temporal point process, we can simulate it on an arbitrary real interval.

history = rand(pp, 3.14, 42.0)

# Each event is defined by a time and an integer mark, which means we can visualize the history in 2 dimensions:

#md scatter(
#md     event_times(history),
#md     event_marks(history);
#md     title="Event history",
#md     xlabel="Time",
#md     ylabel="Mark",
#md     label=nothing,
#md     margin=5Plots.mm
#md )

# ## Learning

# Parameters can learned with Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE):

pp_est = fit_mle(MultivariatePoissonProcess{Float32}, history)

# Let's see how well we did

error = mean(abs, pp_est.位 - pp.位)
